# MSSQL Change Tracking Replication (Rust)

![Dashboard UI Preview](./ui.png)

A Rust application that replicates data from a **Primary MSSQL** instance to a **Replica MSSQL** instance using **Change Tracking**. Synchronization state is managed via **Redis**.

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose

## Quick Start

1.  **Start Services**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

2.  **Initialize Database (One-time Setup)**
    Connect to **Primary MSSQL** (`localhost:1434`, User: `sa`, Pass: `Password123!`) and run:

    ```sql
    -- 1. Create Database
    CREATE DATABASE testct;
    GO
    
    -- Enable Service Broker (Required for DDL Event Notifications)
    ALTER DATABASE testct SET ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    GO

    USE testct;
    GO
    
    -- 2. Enable Change Tracking on Database
    ALTER DATABASE testct
    SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON
    (CHANGE_RETENTION = 2 DAYS, AUTO_CLEANUP = ON);
    GO

    -- 3. Create Table & Enable Change Tracking
    CREATE TABLE [User] (
        id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(100)
    );
    GO

    CREATE TABLE [Customer] (
        CustomerId int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
        ExternalCode nvarchar(50) NOT NULL,
        FullName nvarchar(200) NOT NULL,
        Email nvarchar(200) NULL,
        Status tinyint DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL,
        CreatedAt datetime2(0) DEFAULT sysutcdatetime() NOT NULL,
        UpdatedAt datetime2(0) NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (CustomerId),
        UNIQUE (ExternalCode)
    );
    GO

    CREATE TABLE [Product] (
        id bigint NOT NULL,
        Name text NULL,
        Category varchar(100) NULL,
        Price numeric(10,2) NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    GO

    ALTER TABLE [User]
    ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING
    WITH (TRACK_COLUMNS_UPDATED = ON);
    GO

    ALTER TABLE [Product]
    ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING
    WITH (TRACK_COLUMNS_UPDATED = ON);
    GO

    -- 4. Setup DDL Event Capture (For handling column renames/drops safely)
    CREATE QUEUE SyncDDLQueue;
    GO
    
    CREATE SERVICE SyncDDLService 
    ON QUEUE SyncDDLQueue 
    ([http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/Notifications/PostEventNotification]);
    GO
    
    CREATE EVENT NOTIFICATION SyncDDLEvents
    ON DATABASE
    FOR DDL_TABLE_EVENTS, RENAME
    TO SERVICE 'SyncDDLService', 'current database';
    GO
    ```

3.  **Test Replication**
    Insert data into **Primary**:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO [User] (id, username, email) VALUES (1, 'alice', 'alice@example.com');
    ```
    
    By default, synchronization is paused. You must enable it in Redis to see the data on the **Replica** (`localhost:1435`):
    ```bash
    # Enable synchronization for the 'User' table
    docker exec redis_sync_state redis-cli SET mssql_sync:enabled:User "true"
    ```

## Enable Table Synchronization

By default, any new table discovered with Change Tracking enabled will be paused. To start schema creation and data replication for a specific table, you must set its flag in Redis:

```bash
docker exec redis_sync_state redis-cli SET mssql_sync:enabled:TableName "true"
```

## Force Full Re-Sync/Deploying to Production

When deploying this application to a real production database where Change Tracking has been running for a long time, the app should **not** replay the entire history from version 0. Instead, you should use the Force Full Load feature table by table to snapshot the current state.

1. **Start the App:** Once running, the app creates schema clones on the replica but sets all synchronization (`mssql_sync:enabled:[Table]` and `mssql_sync:force_full_load:[Table]`) to `"false"` by default.
2. **Force Full Load (Small/Medium Tables):** 
   Set the `force_full_load` flag to `"true"`, followed by setting `enabled` to `"true"`. The app will truncate the replica table, chunk-insert all current data, and seamlessly transition into incremental sync for future changes while resetting the `force_full_load` flag back to `"false"`.
   ```bash
   docker exec redis_sync_state redis-cli SET mssql_sync:force_full_load:Product "true"
   docker exec redis_sync_state redis-cli SET mssql_sync:enabled:Product "true"
   ```
3. **Huge Tables (Manual Snapshot):** 
   For extremely large tables, avoid querying the entire table via the app. Instead, perform a manual backup/restore to the Replica. Note the `CHANGE_TRACKING_CURRENT_VERSION()` from the Primary at the time of backup, and manually set it in Redis:
   ```bash
   docker exec redis_sync_state redis-cli SET mssql_sync:version:HugeTable "850550"
   docker exec redis_sync_state redis-cli SET mssql_sync:enabled:HugeTable "true"
   ```

> **Note on Large Tables (Chunked Sync):** 
> To prevent `Out of Memory` errors when syncing tables with millions of rows, the Full Re-Sync feature uses **Keyset Pagination**. It automatically detects the table's Primary Key (or falls back to the first column) and fetches records in chunks of 5,000 rows at a time until the entire table is seamlessly replicated.

## Fault Tolerance & Idempotency

This replication service is heavily designed to be **idempotent**, meaning that unexpected container restarts or disconnections will not result in duplicated or corrupted data.
- **Incremental Sync Interruptions:** Changes are fetched from the `CHANGETABLE` and applied locally using an `UPSERT` pattern (Delete matching PK, then Insert). The tracked `version` in Redis is only updated **after** an entire transaction batch completes successfully. If the application crashes midway, it simply replays the exact same batch on startup with identical results.
- **Force Load Interruptions:** Full-load progress is tracked per table. If an interruption occurs mid-load, the flag `force_full_load` remains `true` in Redis. On the next startup, the crawler will simply `TRUNCATE` the replica table strings again and re-initiate the batch insertion fresh from the start, guaranteeing zero duplications.

## View Synchronization

While tables rely on MSSQL Change Tracking for row-level synchronization, **SQL Views** are automatically kept in sync via definition comparisons.

The application continuously queries `sys.views` and `sys.sql_modules` to compare `CREATE VIEW` statements between the Primary and Replica databases. it will dynamically:
- Create new Views on the Replica if they are found on the Primary.
- Drop and Recreate Views on the Replica if their underlying query definition changes on the Primary.
- Drop Views on the Replica if they are no longer present on the Primary.

## Stored Procedure & Function Synchronization

Along with Views, the app actively monitors and syncs Stored Procedures and User-Defined Functions (`Scalar`, `Table-Valued`, and `Inline Table-Valued`). 

- Using `sys.objects` and `sys.sql_modules`, the logic tracks definition alterations for these routines.
- Changes or additions on the Primary are matched on the Replica by determining the correct drop types (`DROP PROCEDURE` or `DROP FUNCTION`) and recreating the script.
- **Triggers** (`TR`) are strictly ignored from this sync process to prevent event duplication loops or unwanted data cascading effects on the Replica.

## Architecture

- **Primary**: MSSQL 2022 (Port 1434)
- **Replica**: MSSQL 2022 (Port 1435)
- **Redis**: Stores last synced version (Internal Port 6379)
- **App**: Rust service polling changes every 5 seconds.
